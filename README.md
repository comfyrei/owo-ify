# Plugins
My different plugins.

## greentext plugin
Turn lines that begin with ">" into [greentext](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=greentext).

This will not show up for people without the plugin. It's more of a theme for yourself than an extra feature.

Download: [greentext.plugin.js](greentext.plugin.js)

## Hex Color Preview

Hex color values in a message will show up as the color they represent. You can hover over the value to see a popup of that color.

- [x] Add preview size option
- [x] Fix possible issue of slowing down Discord
- [ ] Add option to leave hex values as normal text color, but keep hover preview
- [ ] Add option to keep hex values as their color, but remove hover preview
